### What is EuroCC@Greece?

[EuroCC@Greece](https://eurocc-greece.gr/) is one of the 33 HPC Competence Centres, built in the framework of the [European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU)](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/index_en). It's objectives are to enable the efficient uptake of HPC technologies with the 3-fold goal to advance competitiveness in research, improve effectiveness of government services and promote innovation in industry. In order to achieve this goal, the NCC will address the issues of training and skills development, technology transfer, collaboration with Industry, competence mapping and awareness raising, in the fields of High Performance Computing, High Performance Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data.

EuroCC@Greece is run by a consortium of 5 institutions, namely  

- [GRNET - National Infrastructures for Research and Technology](https://eurocc-greece.gr/grnet-national-infrastructures-for-research-and-technology-coordinator/)  (**coordinator**), 
- [National Center for Scientific Research “Demokritos”](https://eurocc-greece.gr/demokritos/),
- [Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH)](https://eurocc-greece.gr/foundation-for-research-and-technology-hellas-forth/), 
- [Institute of  Communication and Computer Systems of NTUA](https://eurocc-greece.gr/ntua/),  
- [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://eurocc-greece.gr/auth/).  

The project has received funding from the European High-Performance computing Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant agreement No 951732 and the Greek Secretariat for Research and Technology.

### What is this repository?
